## About Me

I am currently a postdoc affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://ise.illinois.edu/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Jeff Shamma](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jshamma). Previously, I received my PhD in Applied Math at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-mathematics) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). Besides, I received my master degree at Harvard and my bachelor degree at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), both in Applied Math. I also did a research intern at [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) in the summer of 2020, working with [Subhro Das](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Subhro.Das).

My research lies in online optimal control, safe learning-based control,  online convex optimization, reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandit, decentralized control, and mechanism design, with applications in smart grids, smart cities, and robotics.

**I am currently on the 2021-2022 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in ECE, CSE, EE, IEOR, ME, etc., related with Control, Optimization, Machine/Reinforcement Learning, with applications in Cyber-physical Systems, Internet of Things, Power Systems. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.**
