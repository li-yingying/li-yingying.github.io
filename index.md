<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering ([ISE](https://ise.illinois.edu/)) at UIUC. I am also an affiliate assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering ([ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/)) and the [Coordinated Science Laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/). 


My research lies in the intersection of statistical/reinforcement learning, control, and optimization. I am especially interested in online and/or distributed learning for control and optimization with safety & optimality guarantees, with applications in smart grids, smart cities, and robotics. Things I work on include online optimal control, safe learning-based control,  online convex optimization, reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandit, decentralized learning for control, reliable mechanism design, etc.

**I am actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs with a strong background in mathematics and interests in applications of smart grid, smart cities, or robotics. Students with a strong background in mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, and/or operation research are especially welcome to apply. Please feel free to apply to either the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering or the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and mention my name in your application if you are interested in joining our group!**

<!--
postdoc in the Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). I received my PhD in Applied Math at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-mathematics) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). Besides, I received my master degree at Harvard and my bachelor degree at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), both in Applied Math. My other research experiences include one year as a postdoc at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://ise.illinois.edu/) in 2021-2022, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Jeff Shamma](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jshamma); and summer research internship at [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) in 2020, working with [Subhro Das](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Subhro.Das).
