## About Me

I am a sixth year Ph.D. candidate at [Harvard SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). I'm working with [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

My research lies in online convex optimization, online optimal control, reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandit, decentralized control, and mechanism design with applications in smart grid.
